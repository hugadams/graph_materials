There are two graph-related ipython notebook's in this repo.  Click for static view:

   - `Comparing Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementations in Python`_

   - `Testing Shortest Path on an Image`_


   .. _`Comparing Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementations in Python`: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hugadams/graph_materials/blob/master/path_algorithm_compare.ipynb
 
   .. _`Testing Shortest Path on an Image`: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hugadams/graph_materials/blob/master/performance.ipynb

The second notebook requires private modules that haven't been included in this repo.
