There are two graph-related ipython notebook's in this repo.  Click for static view:

   `Comparing Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementations in Python`: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hugadams/graph_materials/blob/master/path_algorithm_compare.ipynb
 
   `Testing Shortest Path on an Image`: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hugadams/graph_materials/blob/master/performance.ipynb

The second notebook is not runnable without access to local inputs that are not available.
